# journal
A food and symptom journal for those suffering from autoimmune disease or chronic pain

### Motivation

This project was born shortly after my partner was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition called Ankylosing Spondylitis, or AS. We started building this journal to keep track of her daily pain, as well as the many factors that could be contributing to that pain, with the ultimate hope of being able to see some sort of correlation between the two.

Building this project has been an incredible learning experience and so far has offered me an opportunity to explore new libraries <i>(Ant Design, Formik, React Hooks)</i>, learn about working with a database <i>(Firebase)</i>, and exposed me to managing larger amounts of data than ever before.
